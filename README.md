##About

:p

##Getting Started
Please use Anaconda if you aren't already for some strange reason.  
Create a virtual environment like so:  
```bash
conda create --name **_EnvName_** --file requirements.txt
```

Then activate the environment before you get to work:
```bash
source activate **_EnvName_**
```

Deactivate when you are done like this:
```bash
source deactivate **_EnvName_**
```

##Updates

###Getting them
Just pull the latest changes from the repo! If anything goes wrong due to
dependencies, make sure you get the latest requirements. Like so:  
```bash
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

Do this while your virtual environment is active, of course.

###Making them
If you added a dependency to the environment, keep everyone on the bleeding
edge too! Do this by running:
```bash
conda list --export > requirements.txt
```

Once again, inside of your environment. Just push these changes and everyone
else can refer to the "Getting them" section above. :D

##Misc.

Here are some data science best practice. I like the one that says to mark
your notebooks with your initials:
