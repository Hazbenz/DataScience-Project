what we are goint to do to confirm gentrification using taxi dataset and rental price dataset

# our hypothesis on gentrification: 

	If there were gentrification, the newly moved in people who caused gentriflcation will use taxi rather than bus or subway. 
	
# our goal:

	We are trying to catch existance of the genterification in taxi data set, then 
	we will confirm the gentrificaiton using the rental price data set. 
	
# preprocessing data

1. specify the region that we are interested in.
	-Brookyln
	-Queeens (cross-validation data-set)
	-Bronx (cross-validation data-set)

2. For the region 
	- find out rental price and income changes for several years (5 years to be exact) per neighborhood in Brooklyn, Queens and Maybe Bronx
	- filter the taxi data so that it includes only rows whose drop off, pick up locations, distance and tips amount are in the interested 		  region over 5 years.
